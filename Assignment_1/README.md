# Assignment 1: Machine Learning & Comprehensive EDA

This assignment involves implementing basic Machine Learning tasks and performing detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on multiple datasets.

## Code
- `assignment1_updated.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing EDA, data preprocessing, and initial classification/regression tasks.

## Datasets
- `loan_data.csv`: Used for loan approval prediction analysis.
- `DiabetesPredictionDataset.csv`: Used for diabetes risk assessment.
- `email.csv`: Dataset for spam detection.
- `iris.csv`: Classic dataset for multi-class classification.
- `TamilHandwrittenDataset.csv`: Preliminary exploration of handwritten character data.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed with libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.
2. Open `assignment1_updated.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Run the cells sequentially to see the EDA visualizations (Histograms, Box Plots, Heatmaps) and model outputs.
