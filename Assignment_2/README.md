# Assignment 2: Binary Classification using Naive Bayes and KNN

This assignment focuses on binary classification using the Spambase dataset.

## Code
- `experiment2.ipynb`: Implementation of Naive Bayes (Gaussian, Multinomial, Bernoulli) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers.

## Dataset
- `spambase_csv.csv`: Contains word and character frequency features for spam detection.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed with libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.
2. Open `experiment2.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment.
3. Run the notebook to see the comparison between Naive Bayes and KNN, including hyperparameter tuning for KNN and ROC curve analysis.
