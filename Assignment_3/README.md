# Assignment 3: Regression Analysis

This assignment explores various linear regression models to predict loan request amounts.

## Code
- `experiment3.ipynb`: Implementation of Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net regression models.

## Dataset
- `test.csv`: Contains features like Income, Property Price, and Credit Score used for regression.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed with libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.
2. Open `experiment3.ipynb` in your notebook editor.
3. Run the cells to observe data cleaning steps, log-transformations, and the comparison of different regression techniques using metrics like $R^2$ and RMSE.
