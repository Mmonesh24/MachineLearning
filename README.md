# Machine Learning Assignments

This repository contains a collection of Machine Learning assignments and experiments conducted as part of the 6th-semester curriculum.

## Overview

The project is organized into several assignments, each focusing on different aspects of Machine Learning, from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to Classification and Regression.

### [Assignment 1: Machine Learning & Comprehensive EDA](./Assignment_1/)
- **Focus**: Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on multiple datasets.
- **Key Tasks**: Data visualization (Histograms, Heatmaps, Box plots), handling missing values, and initial data characterization.
- **Datasets**: Loan Data, Diabetes Risk, Spam Detection, Iris, and Tamil Handwritten characters.

### [Assignment 2: Binary Classification](./Assignment_2/)
- **Focus**: Building and evaluating binary classifiers.
- **Key Tasks**: Implementation of Naive Bayes (Gaussian, Multinomial, Bernoulli) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- **Highlights**: Hyperparameter tuning for KNN and comparative analysis using ROC curves and Confusion Matrices.

### [Assignment 3: Regression Analysis](./Assignment_3/)
- **Focus**: Predicting continuous values using linear and regularized models.
- **Key Tasks**: Implementation of Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net regression.
- **Highlights**: Feature engineering (log-transforms), data cleaning, and evaluation using $R^2$ and RMSE metrics.

## Requirements

To run the notebooks in this repository, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the specific assignment folder (e.g., `Assignment_1`).
3. Open the `.ipynb` file to view the implementation and results.
